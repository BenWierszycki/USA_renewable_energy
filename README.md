This repository contains the back-end code for the creation of a database table containing historical energy data (2009-2022) for the United States of America.

Data is fetched from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) using their publicly available API. This data is inserted into the database and then combined with data extracted from National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) to provide state party control data for each state and year combination.
